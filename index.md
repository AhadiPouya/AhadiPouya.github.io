## About Me

I am a **PhD candidate in Machine Learning** at the Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by Dr. Kamran Paynabar. I design **data-efficient AI systems** that combine research depth with industry-ready solutions, specializing in **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **Bayesian Optimization**, and **Deep Learning for Inverse Problems**.  

During my internship with **Intuitive Surgical** (Summer 2025), I:  
- Engineered **LLM-powered systems** integrating **knowledge graphs** and **vector embeddings** for intelligent retrieval.  
- Developed **RAG pipelines** combining multi-source structured and unstructured data for **real-time, context-aware AI applications**.  
- Designed **end-to-end AI workflows** with **agent-based orchestration**, enabling automated data ingestion, retrieval, and reasoning across heterogeneous sources.  

Previously, with **Ford Motor Company**, I:  
- Developed **prompt-optimized LLMs** (PaLM 2, Gemini) with **active learning** loops for customer text classification.  
- Created hierarchical warranty claim classification systems using **uncertainty-based sampling** and **multi-level model integration**.  

In my academic research, I:  
- Designed **Graphormer-based anomaly detection** for 3D lattice structures in advanced manufacturing.  
- Built **Invertible Neural Networks (INNs)** for **latent-space Bayesian Optimization** of high-dimensional functional responses.  
- Proposed robust active learning strategies for noisy labels.
